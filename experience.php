                    Dewan Penggalang AKA Scout Council is an organization in my Junior High School that formed to manage and organize every activity during scout extracurricular every week. We conducted a weekly meeting every Thursday and prepared every stuff that will be used during scout extracurricular. <span class="boldtext">My position in this organization was as a Public Relationship Staff.</span> One of our big agenda at that time was Summer Camps. During this event, I was chosen to be the Night Shift Staff and my job was to supervise and manage every activity at the night time. Due to my school's strict restriction about bringing phone to school, I only have a little bit of documentation of my activity in this organization.

                      When I was in Senior High School, I often get involved in various school events as their committee. My Senior High School had a unique event committee system where every school event had their own committee. When my High School held an event, they opened registration for committee of the event. All students were allowed to enroll and then they selected every student who eligible to be the committee before they announced it. when the event was done, the committe would be dismissed. Some school events that I've ever got involved as their committee are

                    Brainly.co.id is a website where student can ask about their homework and answer other student's homework. As a platform for student discussion, brainly needs a moderator team to supervise the discussion and managing the platform. I have been working as one of their moderator in 2017 until 2018.

But most of the time I played badminton outside my organization agenda with some of my friends. Because my organization schedule always collide with my class in my university. One of my contribution for this organization is I have ever helped my friend who was an administrator of this organization. I helped him to design a google meet virtual background for webinar (online seminar) and a poster for organization event.
